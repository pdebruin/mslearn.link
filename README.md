# Welcome to mslearn.link

## Introduction

Do you ever get confused when you are browsing web pages? That you are opening lots of tabs to review and discover they either are the same or refering in circles? And you really just want to get a list of unique links that you can search and sort? Well...


This is a simple website to collect various entry points to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/). Did you know you can [contribute to Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/)? For instance, you can share a link to Learn with your team, you can answer a question on Q&A, and you can help improve Learn content. 


This site is not owned or endorsed by Microsoft. It is a hobby project to experiment with organizing and structuring websites at scale. It is built using [Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor) and runs on [Azure static web apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview). Source code is available here. Feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request, or by creating an issue.
